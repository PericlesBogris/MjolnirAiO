## Logging

Note:

This Software logs your usage. However, it just sends the amount of usage to my server, you can always delete the lines of code, and most importantly, it uses proxies so your IP-address is hidden. I cant tell who is when using this software, just how often everyone together uses it. Thanks if you support me by this little if you don´t delete the lines.
